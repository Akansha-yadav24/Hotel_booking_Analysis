# Hotel Booking Analysis

This project performs an analysis of hotel booking data to uncover insights related to bookings, customer preferences, and arrival patterns. It answers key questions, such as identifying customers who booked the most children and babies, determining common area codes in phone numbers, and analyzing the number of arrivals within a specific date range.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**:  
  `import pandas as pd`  
  Used for data manipulation and analysis, including handling data in tabular form (DataFrames).

- **NumPy**:  
  `import numpy as np`  
  Used for numerical operations, including handling arrays and performing mathematical calculations.

- **Matplotlib**:  
  `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`  
  Used for creating static visualizations, including graphs and charts.

- **Plotly**:  
  `import plotly.graph_objs as go`  
  `import plotly.io as pio`  
  Used for creating interactive visualizations, including charts and graphs.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hotel_booking_Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Hotel_booking_Analysis
   ```

3. Ensure your environment is set up with all dependencies.


This will process the hotel booking dataset and provide answers to the questions listed below.

## Tasks and Analysis

### 1. People Who Booked the Most Number of Children and Babies
The task is to identify the customers who booked the most number of children and babies during their stay. This involves extracting data about the number of children and babies from the dataset and identifying the customers with the highest values.

### 2. Top 3 Most Common Area Codes in Phone Numbers
This task identifies the most common area codes in the phone numbers provided by the customers. We analyze the phone number column, extract the area codes, and find the top three most frequent area codes.

### 3. Arrivals Between the 1st and 15th of the Month
This task counts how many arrivals took place between the 1st and 15th of the month (inclusive of 1 and 15). The dataset is filtered based on the arrival date, and the number of arrivals within this date range is calculated.

and many more!!
